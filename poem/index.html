        <h1>Jabberwocky</h1>

        <h2>by Lewis Carroll</h2>
        <p>
            <br>
            
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
<br>
    <span>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</span> 
<br>
All mimsy were the borogoves,
<br>
      <span>And the mome raths outgrabe.</span> 
<br>
 <br>

<strong><em>"Beware the <b id= "Jabberwock"> Jabberwock, </b> my son! 
<br>
      <span>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!</span> 
<br>
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
<br>
       <span> The frumious Bandersnatch!"</span> </em></strong> 
<br>
 <br>

He took his vorpal sword in hand;
<br>
     <span>Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”</span> 
<br>
So rested he by the Tumtum tree
<br>
     <span>And stood awhile in thought.</span>
