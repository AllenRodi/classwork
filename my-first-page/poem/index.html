        <h1>Jabberwocky</h1>

        <h2>by Lewis Carroll</h2>
        <p>
            <br>
            
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
<br>
     Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
<br>
All mimsy were the borogoves,
<br>
       And the mome raths outgrabe.
<br>
 <br>

<strong><em>"Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 
<br>
       The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
<br>
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
<br>
       The frumious Bandersnatch!"</em></strong> 
<br>
 <br>

He took his vorpal sword in hand;
<br>
      Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”
<br>
So rested he by the Tumtum tree
<br>
      And stood awhile in thought.
